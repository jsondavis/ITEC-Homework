#This section of the repository contains most of my code from Spring 2013 Intermediate Programming#

-CrazyEights is the project for the spring
-ICX is an In Class Activity
--IC2 was a picture of the completed problems
-HomeworkX is just that a somewhat larger homework problem

###Notes
-I finally started abiding the coding standards
-I have omitted code from the tests
-My deepest apologies for not fixing the package structure in many of these
-I am also rather sorry about quality of my own work on homework 3 and 4
