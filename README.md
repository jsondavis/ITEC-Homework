# Jason Davis -  ITEC Homework @ [*GGC*](http://www.ggc.edu/)

This is a repository of code I wrote to solve the homework problems presented
in ITEC classes.  The problems themselves are in comments at the beginning of the (top level) class file.

The folder myersbriggs contains code for the project problem 1.
