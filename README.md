# Jason Davis -  ITEC Homework @ [*GGC*](http://www.ggc.edu/)

This is a repository of code I wrote to solve the homework problems presented
in ITEC classes.  

-The intro problems themselves are in comments at the beginning of the (top level) class file.
-The intro folder myersbriggs contains code for the project problem 1.
